             and I have had a strange and exciting journey to becoming a programmer. I started out at New York University-Stern 
             School of Business studying math and finance. Pretty soon I had found out about another program at NYU, the Clive Davis 
             Institute of Recorded Music. At the time, I was an electronic music producer and DJ on the side, and was presented with an opportunity 
             to pursue my passion in a concrete way. So by winter break, I was working on my audition material, and by the end of 
             the year was accepted as a new transfer student into the program.</p>

            <p>While working towards a BFA in Music Production, I also picked up a minor in Web Programming and Applications at NYU to 
                 find an outlet for my more technical interests. After graduating, I worked as a recording engineer in
                 New York City music studios, working with singers, rappers, instrumentalists, etc. While the trade is more creative 
                 than technical, it taught me how to learn new skills quickly and how to work under pressure to meet a client's
                 needs. </p>

            <p>While the problem-solving element of my work was fun, I found myself missing the intellectual stimulation that I got in my 
                 calculus and coding classes. So I took a step back from my music work to focus my energy on becoming a skilled programmer, 
                 with hopes of writing new and innovative applications to find solutions for creatives and executives in music, entertainment, 
                 and beyond.
